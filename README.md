 **Hi, Iâ€™m  Vera Lukashina ðŸ‘‹**

Data Scientist with a background in financial management and analytical experience.

I completed a professional training course in Data Science, working on 20 projects across banking, telecom, industry, tourism, and online services. 

I hold a degree in Financial Management and have several years of experience in financial analysis and cash flow management.

I am eager to apply my skills in data-driven decision-making, business optimization, and predictive modeling.

Iâ€™m also interested in contributing to volunteer data projects related to education, economics, or social impact.
